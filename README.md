Stevos-Hot-Wings
-------------

Hello to whomever might be reading this, my partner, Keyon Mobley, and I, Chamiya Spates, are thrilled to explain to you our whole website process that we've put hard work into. We hope you enjoy our website!

Stevo's Hot Wings is a small fast food restauraunt that is located here in Jackson. As we were thinking on what to do our website on, our main area was restauraunts. We had to think "Okay which restauraunt is worthy of a website?" or something along those lines. Restauraunt websites are on the rise now as people rather look up the menu first before heading down to the restauraunt first. I mean who can blame them? Would you like if you fully went with your instincts on "Oh they might have hamburgers" just to get there and see they only serve ONE dish in 340224 ways! That's why we took on the aspect of Stevo's Hot Wings. 

Although hot wings is in the name, it way more entrees and meals served at Stevo's. Stevo's has gained a lot of popularity over the past 7 seven years of their operation. Surprisingly, they didn't have a website and we knew from there that this was destined for us.

Website Features:

The homepage: 
   We wanted to keep the homepage short and sweet just to give our other pages some more in depth analyzing. I put a nice, satisfying picture of wings for our background and soften the opacity of the image so it wouldn't appear too strong behind our words. I simply added the words "The Best Wings in Jackson", which was accompanied by a button that led them to our menu to further entice the customers. Usually when you're hungry and looking for a place to eat, the website needs to get straight to the point and hook you in. What's better than using a delicious backdrop of some hot wings with our appealing title in huge lettering that furthers your hunger and eagerness to get those wings.

The About Us:
   We found ourselves having to really get the scoop on this restaraunt with this page. It really surprised us as we didn't know how long Stevo's has been around. We addressed that and other small topics in our opening paragraph. To further give them an insight on Stevo's we included four pictures that showed them the interior of the restaraunt and also a picture of their sign so they know what to look out for!
--------------------------------------
   
The MENU:
  To make it easier on the eyes, we created a menu on our own on a seperate website. The menu touches on every item that you can get at Stevo's that is disclosed on the menu at the restauraunt. I went for a neutral, aesthetic color scheme that would make you want to read this whole menu over and over, making you plan future meals for your next visits! We didn't want the menu to have too much content or small lettering as that can hurt potential business. When you can't read the most important aspect of a restauraunt, your brain starts to think, "Hey.. Chick-Fil-A has a better menu than this.. LET'S GO!" and we definitely don't want to scurry away customers. 
--------------------------------------
  
The Hours of Operation:
  This page was an easy overall task. Nothing too fancy, just straight to the point. We listed the hours in a table and the title "Opening Hours" with the red neon look to it, to compare with the neon of an "OPEN" sign. 
--------------------------------------
  
 The Party Packz:
  As you might know, wings are an essential item to any party/event. We decided to make their catering choices have their own page instead of just throwing it on the menu. Customers might be coming to the menu solely on the intents to order a huge pan of hot wings and we don't want to confuse them. This menu was also made on the same website used for our initial menu. It gives off the sporty feel with the font we used, which accessorized our small paragraph on planning the food for "Super bowl parties" and etc. There wasn't much content on this page as those are the only catering options that we are given.
-----------------------------------
  
The Contact Us: 
 Once again this page needs to be short and sweet, BUT informational. We had a brief intro that gave all important info for contacting us. We also added two Google maps that gave our customers two different ways to locate the restaraunt. We had a street view option and a regular map view option so the customers could see how it really looks & see what's around for a better guide. 
--------------------------------------

Creating this website was a fun, but difficult process. I had many run ins with some altercations that hindered our website process. We had to due a lot of researching and we had to contain a lot of knowledge. It even made me start to make other websites for peoplem out of my own interest in web designing. As I have said many times in the paragraphs above, we wanted the customers to have an easy, accessible website at their fingers. Nothing too complicated that even a five year old could grasp the idea on how to function the website. We've definitely learned alot these past 3 months, and hopefully, but surely, this learning experience will benefit us in the future. Thank you!
